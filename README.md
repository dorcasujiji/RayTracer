# Raytracer 
A ray tracer program that displays a scene based on description of input file in JSON format.

Before running: 
1. Add json.simple jar file to build path 

Input Format: 
The raytracer program accepts filepath as command line arguments or as user input after running the program. 

The input file should be a JSON file with a list of scene objects and their descriptions. The file should have a single list of objects in square braces, separated by commas. The objects' parameters should be string (for object type), numbers (for dimension, color rgb-values or vector xyz-component) or objects themselves (vectors and colors). 


How to create image with following "type": 
1. "scene" requires parameters: width, height (of window & viewport), max_ray_depth, field_of_view and background_color.

2. "light" objects are spherical with light rays and need parameters: center, radius and emmission_color (color of light rays). 

3. "sphere" objects require: center, radius, color, reflectivity (0>=r>=1), transparency (0>=t>=1), and index_of_refraction (recommeded 0.9 >= i >= 1.1). 

// Note: planes do not display shadows for now but are fine otherwise
4. "plane" objects require: center, normal (to the plane), width, height, color, normal, reflectivity (0>=r>=1).

Example: Acceptable file with light, sphere and plane
